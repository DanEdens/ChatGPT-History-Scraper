# ChatGPT History Scraper

## Overview
ChatGPT History Scraper is a Python script that uses Selenium to scrape and save historical data of a website. The script clicks on each selector in a provided list, waits for the page to load, and saves a .mhtml copy of the page.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome webdriver

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatGPT-History-Scraper.git
```

pip install selenium

```
3. Check if the Chrome webdriver exists, and download it if it's not found:
```

## Usage
```
python chatgpt_history_scraper.py
```

Replace `selectors`, `url`, and `webdriver_path` with your own values in the script. The script will return a list of filenames for the saved .mhtml copies of the webpages.
